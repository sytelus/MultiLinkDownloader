Planet Source Code Downloader 

Planet Source Code is one of the huge resources of VB code. Say you want to download all of it's listing and make a CD that might serve as 1000s of VB code snippets. This program exactly does that. It's actually general purpose program that downloads all the pages having address like 
http://www.somesite.com/some-junk/wanted_pageXXXX.htm - where XXXX is number ranging from 0000 to 9999. 
I used same program to download all the postings in particular email list at www.listbot.com. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code in clsListFetcher.GetAMessage to use it for different URLs. However you may freely contact me for assistance.
